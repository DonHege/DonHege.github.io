This page does not serve any purpose. It is only used by me
to play around with some HTML and CSS. Most of the things I've done on the web so far
were based on CMS systems or frameworks like Bootstrap. This time, I want to see what
I can achieve and do when I do everything from scratch. Therefor, don't expect too much
fancy content to pop up on this page.

But here are some things I want to do:	
1. Keep the source easy to read, so everybody who is interested can read it easily.
1. Make the page responsive, so it scales to the size of your display. It should work from 
feature phones to 4K displays.
1. Only use open web technologies - no Flash, Air or Silverlight.
1. Be standard-compliant. :)

So if you see anything on this page that is not working or could be solved in a better way, please
let me know, I'm willing to learn the best practices.
